This directory contains all Flame-, Nuke- and 3DE4-projects.
for testing the lens distortion export for Autodesk(R) Flame.

The procedure is the following:
Starting in Foundry(R) Nuke we create a sequence of distorted
images. We import these images in 3DE4 and set up the camera and lens
the same way, including camera and distortion parameters and dynamic
focal lens or dynamic focus distance. We then export a batch to Flame,
import it in Flame and examine the results.


test_1
--------------------
- The test is about checking export data for a single frame.
- Radial - Standard, Degree 4
- We create an image with
  + non-standard fov
  + non-standard lco
  + non-default c2
  + everything else is default, pixel aspect is 1.
- Distort with Nuke
- Undistort with Flame and compare.

- w_fb_cm = 2.048
- h_fb_cm = 1.024
- r_pa = 1.0
- Sequenz, Frames 1-11
- Frame 1:
  + c2 = 0.05
  + u2 = 0.05
  + v2 = 0.07
  + c4 = -0.05
