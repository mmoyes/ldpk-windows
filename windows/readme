This directory is meant for compiling the lens distortion plugins
for Nuke under Windows, for Nuke Version >= 11.0.
You will find the plugins compiled by us under $LDPK/compiled/nuke/windows/...
yet, in case you want to compile them yourself, please have a look at
directory LD_3DE4_NukeMultiRelease. It contains a solution file for
Visual Studio 2015, the one recommended by The Foundry for compiling
plugins as of Nuke11.0.

Nuke versions are realized as "configurations" in Visual Studio,
so if you wish to add a new version of Nuke, please open Visual Studio's
Configuration Editor for the Solution and add a new configuration.

Once you have added a new configuration, update the "additional include paths"
and library paths for the current version of Nuke.

Remember to set the configuration in Visual Studios tool bar
to "ReleaseNukeX.Y" and "x64" before building the solution.
